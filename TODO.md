# TODO

We collect all the items (e.g., features, bug fixes) that need to be done here

## Items

* [x] check that hypothgraph has annotations (e.g., 'evidenced': yes | no, 'btwin_centrality': [0, 1])
* [x] more graph mutation refactoring (assignment of boundary nodes, of evidences etc.)
* [x] test and refactor confidence propagation code for path graphs (simplest cases)
* [x] add boundary functions, as, nodes within boundary (all accessible via simple paths) and outside
* [x] test confidence with more complex graphs
* [ ] ratio confidence sub hypothesis to full hypothesis
* [ ] closest confidence to the max confidence given some constraints
